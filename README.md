Crash Severity Detection System (CSDS)

Crash Severity Detection (CSD) is a complex system that utilizes various sensors and algorithms to estimate the severity of a traffic accident in real-time.

Imagine a world where emergency responders instantly know the seriousness of a crash before they even arrive, allowing them to prioritize resources and potentially save lives. 
That's the power of CSDS.

> Potential for reducing accidents and saving lives
 Working Principle of Crash Severity Detection (CSD)


 The crucial information obtained via CSDS helps emergency responders prioritize dispatch and allocate resources effectively, potentially saving lives. 

Here's a breakdown of the working principle:

We will be using an Arduino Uno, collision detection sensor, FSR and a GPS module to capture the co-ordinates of the location.
 
These values will be processed by a python script and will be stored in a database. These database values will be updated on a webpage which can be seen and accessed by emergency services or even by police. 

NodeMCU cannot store the previous accident values and all the data gets erased when it gets powered off. 
This is the reason why we are not using NodeMCU for creating a local webpage. Instead, we will be creating a local server (Apache server) and a local database (mySQL database) using Xampp application.
Severity Classification and Response
* - Based on the processed data and analysis, the system classifies the accident severity level. This information is then used for:
* - Emergency dispatch prioritization:Severe accidents trigger immediate dispatch of ambulances, firefighters, and police.
* - First responder preparation: Provides them with critical information about the scene and potential injuries before arrival.
* - Automatic safety system activation: In some advanced systems, airbags or other safety measures might be activated based on the predicted severity.
* - Accident analysis and prevention: CSD data can be used to identify accident patterns and high-risk areas, informing prevention strategies and infrastructure improvements.

Challenges and Future of CSDS:

1. Accuracy can be affected by sensor quality, environmental conditions, and vehicle types.
2. Ethical considerations regarding data privacy and potential misuse of technology.
3. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication: Integration of CSDS with V2X technology will enable real-time data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure, further enhancing safety and emergency response.
4. Widespread adoption: As the benefits of CSDS become evident, we can expect wider adoption by car manufacturers, governments, and insurance companies.
